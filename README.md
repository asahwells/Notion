# Notion
Graphql-faker was used as a mock api because it was easier to generate new data per refresh
Tailwind is one of the best CSS framework and i'm very familiar with it
React-native-timeline-flatlist was also used for rendering the items, its very effective and reduces more codes.
NOTE: To start the app, run yarn/npm ios which ever you install and then yarn mock:api
